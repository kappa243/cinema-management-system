## About

The main goal of the project, was to implement previously learned technologies **(JavaFX, RxJava, Spring)** and design patterns **(MVC, MVP)** into the project, as well as use tools to support object-relational mapping **(Java Persistence API)**, writing tedious parts of code **(lombok)** and improving the visual quality of the product **(MaterialFx)**.
